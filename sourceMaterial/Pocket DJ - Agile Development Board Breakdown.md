### **Agile Development Board Breakdown for Pocket DJ (PodJi)**

**Guiding Principles:** All development will adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Component-Driven Development (CDD) methodologies. Unit and integration tests will be written before implementation, and UI components will be built in isolation using Storybook before being integrated into the main applications.
